    <p>Probably my all-time favorite Robin Williams flick. <br /> 
    Something about it just rings nostalgia to me every time I watch it.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>

    <p>The sole movie that hooked my interest into anime.<br />
    Alongside Princess Mononoke, of course.</p>

<hr />

<h3>The Sandlot</h3>

    <p>Who doesn't love this movie?<br />
    Squints. Wendy. Yeah-Yeah. Benny. Ham.<br />
    A classic.</p>
