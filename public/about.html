<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jordan Brown. I am new to Web Development, and I am excited to teach myself this new skill.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a Full Stack Developer and to pursue a career in this field. There are so many things
  you can do in Web Development, and I cannot wait to get started. First, with HTML like you see here. Then,
  on to CSS to style things up. Finally, way on down the line, learning React and creating my own Crypto Token!
 *According to the curriculum, that is.*</p>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I hope you stick around, and follow along with my progress as I dive head-first into
  this field!</p>
